addVhost.rb
===========

A ruby script that adds a new domain and wordpress website to a LAMP server.

* Creates a MySQL database
* Sets up your Apache configuration
* Restarts Apache
* Downloads and unzips Wordpress
* Configures your wp-config.php file (including the random security salts)

That's all for now.
